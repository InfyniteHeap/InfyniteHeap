# Self-Introduction

I'm InfyniteHeap, a chronically sleep-deprived undergraduated student. I am
either sleeping or sinking into sleep... ≧ ﹏ ≦

## Hobbies

- Learn knowledge about computer science, including but not limited to...
  - programming language
  - compilation theories
  - operating system
- Play games...
  - Minecraft
  - Genshin Impact
  - Honkai: Star Rail
  - ~~Zenless Zone Zero~~ (It is a pity that I'll probably no longer logging in
    this game for a long time because I am a little tired...)

## Abilities

- Program with **Rust** (MAJOR), C# and C++ (less skilled than the former ones)
- Develop a simple Unity game

I'm still constantly exploring new things and learning them! Welcome to
communicate with me at any time!
